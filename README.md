# Task-Manager

This is a simple task management tool I use to manage bigger projects. Born out of a desire to have a to-do list but for things that take longer than a day, I decided to make my first JS project a personalized project management tool. 

To use, simply put in the name of the task you need to accomplish, put in a due date in the format mm/dd/yyyy, hit submit, and the tool will display all the tasks you've entered and their due dates below.
